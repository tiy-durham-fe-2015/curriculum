- Syntax

## Exercise(s)

### Calculator

- Implement the calculator that I demonstrated.
- Make some new buttons (multiply, divide, and mod)
- Try adding a third variable and textbox

### Converter

- Create a form where:
  - User inputs "Quantity/volume"
  - User clicks button "Cups to Quarts"
  - Alert the amount in quarts (1 cup is 0.25 quarts)
- Make a quarts to cups converter
- Make a meters to yards converter
- Make a yards to meters converter
- Make a Fahrenheit to celcius converter
- Make a celcius to Fahrenheit converter

## Assignment

- Finish your converter logic
- Pretty up your converter form(s) and publish to GitHub pages
- Make sure your alerts read like English:
  (e.g. if the user enters 34, alert "34 quarts is 136 cups")
- See if you can output the results to the screen, instead of alerting them.
